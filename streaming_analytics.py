    So, this dataset shows the data for a year. This won't necissarily
    give a full idea of the company's overall trends, but might reflect
    seasonal trends and developments from the 2022 - 2023 year.

    3069 total entries, 2004 non-null canceled_date entries. This means
    1065 entries are still active subscriptions (about a third of total entries).
    A two-thirds drop in subscriptions over a year is quite significant.
    Seeing as this dataset's timeframe includes the end of COVID lockdowns,
    it is not necessarily surprising to see a large drop off in subscriptions
    as people return to in-person activities.
    
    I will be reflecting the distribution of cancel dates over time.
    With the above in mind, I predict the cancellations will skew towards
    The end of the datase's timeframe.
